# elon-musk-classifier
Tried to build a classifier to identify whether Elon Musk is smiling or not.

# Results
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a lower loss than 16% due to the little amount of time I had to build it. Gathering a larger dataset should have gotten great results.

Built using the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) library on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
